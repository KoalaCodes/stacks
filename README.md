## About The Project
The project's intent is to be a portfolio investing application complemented with a social community built around it. I chose this project because I have an interest in building wealth via the stock market. I felt many others can share the sentiment.

## Long-Term Goals
- For future development, the focus would shift to implementing a search feature to look at a stock then adding the data. 
- Then develop the social element to the app: follow, trending, and friendlist. 
- clean up the UI.
